# [Jack Farmer Test Website](https://jackfaarmer.github.io)

### Description

This is a test site/playground to show off my projects, skills, and general hobbies. Here, I utilize core web-based languages such as:

* HTML,
* CSS, and
* JavaScript

as well as frameworks adjacent to webdev. This site will progressively improve as I do, as I will reflect everything I utilize and learn here.

Please visit [jackfaarmer.github.io](https://jackfaarmer.github.io) to see the active site.
